# ThesisDotTex
Thesis.tex is simply a template for those enthusiastic PhD candidates eager to finish up their Doctorates with a beautiful thesis in Latex! ðŸŽ“ðŸ“‘â˜•

## Credits
Major credits to (ex) PhD candidates (and thus doctors by now): dr. Bart Besselink, dr. Benjamin Biemond, and dr. Mark Rijnen for their contribution to the template! 99.9% of the credits should go to these guys, I'm merely the guy who decided to put it on git.
